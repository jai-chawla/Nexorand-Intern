*** A LinkTree clone both frontend(reactjs and tailwind css) and backend(Nodejs, express, mongoDB)
*** Both the frontend and backend are hosted on vercel.com
*** I have tried my best to make the frontend as similiar as possible
*** For now this website is only desktop/laptop friendly
*** i can also make it responsive for smaller devices but due to deadline i have only implemented the CSS for large screen devices otherwise i might not be able to complete it before deadline
*** For databse i have used mongodb atlas(cloud DB)
*** When the user will create an account on sign up page the password of user will be hashed first then will be stored in DB
*** When the user will try to log in, the backend will check for existing user in DB and then compare the credentials, if matched then user will be logged in
*** after signing in and logging in, a token will be generated from JWT and will be stored on client's browser for seamless login.
